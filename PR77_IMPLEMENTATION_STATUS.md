# PR #77 Implementation Status Report

## Overview
PR #77 aimed to modernize PyStore with multiple phases of improvements. This report summarizes what has been implemented and what's currently working based on our testing.

## Successfully Implemented Features ✅

### 1. Basic PyStore Functionality
All core PyStore features from the README are working correctly:
- Creating and managing stores
- Creating and managing collections
- Writing data to collections
- Reading data from collections
- Appending data to existing items
- Metadata handling
- Query functionality (filtering items by metadata)
- Snapshot creation and management
- Deleting items and collections

### 2. README Updates
- Successfully updated README.rst to replace Quandl examples with yfinance
- Example code now uses: `yf.download("AAPL", multi_level_index=False)`

### 3. Basic Data Type Support
- Standard pandas DataFrames with numeric and datetime indices work correctly
- Basic append operations function properly after fixing the nanosecond issue

## Partially Implemented Features ⚠️

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling
- Custom exception classes have been added to `pystore/exceptions.py`
- Basic error handling is in place
- Some error messages could be more informative

### 2. Data Transformations
- Basic data transformations are working (datetime to int64 conversion)
- Complex type handling has issues (see below)

## Features with Implementation Issues ❌

### 1. MultiIndex Support
- Code is present but has dtype compatibility issues with PyArrow
- String types are being converted to PyArrow string types causing test failures

### 2. Complex Data Types
- Period, Interval, and Categorical types have implementation but fail during serialization
- Nested objects (lists, dicts) fail due to pandas ambiguity issues with `pd.notna()`
- Nested DataFrames fail for similar reasons

### 3. Advanced Features Not Fully Integrated
- Async operations (`AsyncCollection`) - framework present but not tested
- Transactions - code exists but not integrated with main operations
- Schema evolution - has syntax errors that were fixed but functionality not fully tested
- Memory management - framework present but not tested
- Streaming append - referenced in tests but uses non-existent parameters
- Partitioning optimization - `partition_on` parameter not recognized
- Sparse data - not supported by PyArrow

### 4. Performance Features
- Time-based partitioning code exists but not fully tested
- Batch operations framework present but not tested

## Deprecation Warnings to Address
1. `datetime.utcnow()` → `datetime.now(datetime.UTC)`
2. `is_period_dtype` → `isinstance(dtype, pd.PeriodDtype)`
3. `is_interval_dtype` → `isinstance(dtype, pd.IntervalDtype)`
4. `is_categorical_dtype` → `isinstance(dtype, pd.CategoricalDtype)`
5. `is_datetime64tz_dtype` → `isinstance(dtype, pd.DatetimeTZDtype)`

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use
PyStore with PR #77 is suitable for:
- Standard time series data storage and retrieval
- Basic DataFrame operations with numeric data
- Metadata-based querying
- Snapshot functionality

### Areas Needing Further Development
1. **Complex Type Handling**: The `pd.notna()` checks need to be refactored to handle array-like objects properly
2. **MultiIndex Support**: Need to resolve PyArrow string type compatibility
3. **Advanced Features**: Many advanced features need integration testing and debugging
4. **Documentation**: Need to document which features are production-ready vs experimental

### Test Coverage
- Created comprehensive tests for README examples (all passing)
- Created tests for PR #77 features (many failing due to implementation issues)
- Suggest focusing on stabilizing core features before enabling advanced features

## Conclusion
PR #77 brings valuable modernization to PyStore, but many of the advanced features need additional work before they're production-ready. The core functionality remains solid and the codebase is better organized with improved error handling.
